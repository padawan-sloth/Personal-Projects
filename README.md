Titanic Survival Predictions Using Random Forest

Description:

This submission predicts the survival outcomes of passengers aboard the Titanic, leveraging a Random Forest Classifier trained on demographic and socio-economic features. The model was selected for its high accuracy and ability to handle both categorical and numerical data effectively.

Methodology:

1) Data Preprocessing:

Addressed missing values in 'Age', 'Cabin', and 'Embarked' using median and mode imputation.
Created 'FamilySize' by combining 'SibSp' and 'Parch'.
Employed label encoding to transform categorical variables such as 'Sex', 'Cabin', and 'Embarked'.

2) Model Selection:

Compared Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, and Random Forest models based on cross-validation accuracy.
Chose Random Forest due to its robust performance, achieving approximately 80.1% accuracy.

3) Validation:

Ensured the model's generalization using training data splits for validation.

4) Final Predictions:

Applied the trained model to the test set after ensuring consistent data preprocessing.

Conclusion:

The predictions submitted are generated by a well-validated model, aiming to understand survival patterns based on available passenger data. The use of Random Forest highlights the importance of handling complex feature interactions and the effectiveness of ensemble methods in predictive accuracy.
